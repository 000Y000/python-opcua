pure python opcua client (and maybe server later)

* most code autogenerated from xml specification
* connection to server, opening channel, session works
* browsing and reading attributes value works
* adding more functionnality shoud be trivial since most code is autogenerated
* api is or will be the same as the python bindings of freeopcua c++ client
